# Comments
print("This is a comment file")

# In Python, there are 2 ways to write comments in the code. 
# If you have a single-line comment, you need to place the '#' (pound sign) in front of the line, like this:
# This is a comment.
# You can also use the shortcut key to add this type of comment in the code. 
# To do this, select the lines and press CTRL+/ and the comment will be automatically added. 
# You can also apply this to multiple lines by selecting them all at once.

# The next type of comment is done using ''' (triple single quotes) or """ (triple double quotes). 
# You need to add triple single quotes or double quotes at the start and end of the comment, like this:
"""This is a comment"""

# This method can also be used for multi-line comments, like this:
"""
This
is
a
multi-line
comment
"""

# You can also use single quotes for comments, as shown below:
'''This is a comment'''

# For multi-line comments with single quotes:
'''
This
is
a
single-quotedc                                 
multi-line
comment
'''
