# You can also perform these calculations (+, -, /, *) directly in your terminal or PowerShell. 
# To do so, you only need to open the terminal and type `python`, and hit Enter to launch the Python interpreter. 
# Once the Python interpreter is open, you can directly perform calculations like this:
# 5*2
# 5/2
# 5-2
# 5+2
# Note: You don't need to add quotation marks (' or ") in the print statement. 
# If you include them, the output will display exactly what is inside the quotation marks, like this: `print("5*2")`.
# As a result, the output will be the string `5*2` instead of the result `10`.

# The process is simple: open the terminal or PowerShell, type `python`, and you'll enter the REPL. 
# REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, which allows you to interactively type and evaluate Python code.
