# Install and use the Module
# We use the following line of code in the terminal to install the module:
# pip install pyjokes

# Now, to execute the installed module, we use the import statement as shown below:
import pyjokes
print(pyjokes.get_joke())

# You can also install more modules that are open-sourced and reusable.
# Like you can also install the Flask module by using the following:
# pip install flask
