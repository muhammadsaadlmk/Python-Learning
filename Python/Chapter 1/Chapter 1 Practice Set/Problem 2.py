# Use of REPL
# Open the terminal or PowerShell on your system and type the following code to print the table of 5.

# Method 1: Using print() for each multiplication step
# In this method, we use the print() function to output the result of each multiplication.

print(5*1)
print(5*2)
print(5*3)
print(5*4)
print(5*5)
print(5*6)
print(5*7)
print(5*8)
print(5*9)
print(5*10)

# Method 2: Directly typing the multiplication expressions (works in Python interactive shell or terminal)
# This method works when you are using Python interactively, and you can directly type the expressions.
"""
5*1
5*2
5*3
5*4
5*5
5*6
5*7
5*8
5*9
5*10
"""
# Both methods will output the multiplication table for 5.
# The first method uses print() to display each result, while the second method displays the result directly in an interactive Python environment.
# This can be done by using REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) Method.
