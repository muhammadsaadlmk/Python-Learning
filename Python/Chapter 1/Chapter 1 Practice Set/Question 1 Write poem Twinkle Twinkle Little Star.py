# There are two ways to write the poem in Python. One way is to print every line individually like below:
print("Print every line code is printing poem")
print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,")
print("How I wonder what you are!")
print("Up above the world so high,")
print("Like a diamond in the sky.")
print("When the blazing sun is gone,")
print("When he nothing shines upon,")
print("Then you show your little light,")
print("Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.")
print("Then the trav'ller in the dark,")
print("Thanks you for your tiny spark,")
print("He could not see which way to go,")
print("If you did not twinkle so.")
print("In the dark blue sky you keep,")
print("And often thro' my curtains peep,")
print("For you never shut your eye,")
print("Till the sun is in the sky.")
print("'Tis your bright and tiny spark,")
print("Lights the trav'ller in the dark:")
print("Tho' I know not what you are,")
print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star.")

# The second method is to use triple quotes (either single or double) to write the whole poem at once.
# This way, you can write the entire poem in a multi-line string and print it all together.

# Single Quotes:
print("Single Qoutes")
print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Then the trav'ller in the dark,
Thanks you for your tiny spark,
He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep,
And often thro' my curtains peep,
For you never shut your eye,
Till the sun is in the sky.

'Tis your bright and tiny spark,
Lights the trav'ller in the dark:
Tho' I know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.''')

# Double Quotes:
print("Double Qoutes")
print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,

Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
